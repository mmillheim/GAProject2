## Introduction and Description
Levels App is a simple inventory management app where item can be linked to vendors and their quantities can be tracked.


### How to use the App
The initial screen lists all items in the system with their quantites and vendors. The navbar contains links for this item view and the vendor list. Click on an item's name or part number to view the item. There is a button to enter the edit screen for the item in this view. Clicking on the vendor name will bring you to the vendor view screen where you can view the vendor information, see a list of items associated with the vendor, and edit the vendor.

## Design
As part of the of design process I created user stories to frame up what capabilities I would like to add to the app. They are divided into *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)* and *Stretch Goals*.

#### MVP:
At it's bare mininum the app should...
- display a list with the inventory levels for all items
- display a list with all vendors
- allow CRUD on all items and vendors

#### Stretch Goals:
- add support for transaction tracking
- add support for entering purchase orders
- user authentication
- ability to have more than one company / inventory
- assigning users to a specific company
